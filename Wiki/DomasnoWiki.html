    <h3 style="color: #0645ad;">History of Coding</h3>
    <p>Coding, also known as programming, has a rich history. It began in the early 19th century with Ada Lovelace, who is credited with writing the first algorithm for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. However, coding as we know it today really took off in the mid-20th century with the development of high-level programming languages like Fortran and COBOL. The 1970s brought us languages such as C and Pascal, laying the foundation for modern software development. In the 1990s, the World Wide Web was born, leading to the explosion of web development and scripting languages like HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Today, coding is an integral part of our digital world, powering everything from apps to artificial intelligence.</p>
